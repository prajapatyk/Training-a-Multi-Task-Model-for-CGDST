Entire Dataset containing 800 images is divided into five folds containing 160 images each initially.
The images in fold0 will be selected for validation dataset and images from rest other folds are selected for training dataset. This will be carried out for all the folds.
We create new folds as:
fold0 = imagesInFold0AsValidation + imagesInOtherFoldsAsTraining

The DataAugmentation will be performed only on the training dataset in each fold.

DataAugmentation Techniques:
	RandomBrightness: [0.25, 0.35, 0.45]
	Random Contrast and Random Saturation: [0.2, 0.4], [0.3, 0.6], [0.4, 0.8]
	Random Hue: [0.1, 0.3, 0.5]
	Salt and pepper noise: amount = [0.04, 0.07, 0.1]
	gaussian_noise and speckle noise: [mean: variance] = mean=0, var=[ 0.004, 0.008, 0.012]

For each fold we have two subfolder training and validation containing training and validation images respectively.
Training contains 640 images and validation contains 160 images.
When the model is being trained the augmentation techniques will be applied
on training images.
